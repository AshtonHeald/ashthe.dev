import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

import StaticCard from "@/components/othercard.astro";
import InteractiveCard from "@/components/testcard.vue";

<StaticCard title="Static Information" variant="info">
This card is rendered at **build time** with no JavaScript sent to the browser.

- Zero client-side JS
- Perfect for SEO
- Fast loading

</StaticCard>

## Interactive Content (Vue Island)

<InteractiveCard 
  client:load 
  title="Interactive Features" 
  variant="default"
  initialExpanded={true}
>
This card is a **Vue island** that becomes interactive on the client!

- Click the + button to collapse/expand
- Click the like button
- Add notes in the input field

The rest of the page is still static, but this component is fully interactive.

</InteractiveCard>

## Another Vue Island with Different Loading Strategy

<InteractiveCard 
  client:visible 
  title="Lazy Loaded" 
  initialExpanded={false}
>
This Vue component only loads when it becomes visible in the viewport.

Great for **performance** when you have many interactive components!

</InteractiveCard>

This theme comes with the [@astrojs/mdx](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) integration installed and configured in your `astro.config.mjs` config file. If you prefer not to use MDX, you can disable support by removing the integration from your config file.

<Button>Button</Button>
<span class="text-amber-600">Test</span>

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require("./lang/" + l);
  return true;
};
```

## Why MDX?

MDX is a special flavor of Markdown that supports embedded JavaScript & JSX syntax. This unlocks the ability to [mix JavaScript and UI Components into your Markdown content](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#mdx-features) for things like interactive charts or alerts.

If you have existing content authored in MDX, this integration will hopefully make migrating to Astro a breeze.

## Example

Here is how you import and use a UI component inside of MDX.  
When you open this page in the browser, you should see the clickable button below.

- **Note:** [Client Directives](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#client-directives) are still required to create interactive components. Otherwise, all components in your MDX will render as static HTML (no JavaScript) by default.
