<SectionHeading>Project Summary</SectionHeading>

In 2022, I built a pixel-perfect static mockup of the Ethereum.org homepage as it appeared that year. The goal was to practice translating an existing design into clean, responsive code. I chose to implement it with Bootstrap and Sass to strengthen my skills with these technologies, particularly integrating Sass and Bootstrap together. This project is now archived but served as a valuable step in refining my front-end fundamentals.
