# About

<SectionHeading>Introduction</SectionHeading>

I’m passionate about solving problems, building projects I'm proud of, and making the web more accessible for everyone. My journey in development started in 2018 when I attended a web development and design bootcamp. That’s where I discovered my love for coding.

<SectionHeading>Skills & Strengths</SectionHeading>

I specialize in front-end development and the JavaScript ecosystem. I’m framework agnostic and comfortable with any CSS solution. I'm highly adaptable and quick to learn new technologies. My attention to detail and eye for design help me translate designs into functional reality. I have an innate ability to solve problems and persevere through challenges.

<SectionHeading>Values & Philosophy</SectionHeading>

My work is founded on honesty, inclusivity, and the pursuit of quality. I’m naturally curious and apply a growth mindset. I believe great software is born from the intersection of technical excellence and human empathy.

My approach is guided by three core principles:

- **User-Centric:** Technology should serve people
- **Performance:** Fast and reliable experiences
- **Continuous Learning:** Always evolving

<SectionHeading>Hobbies & Interests</SectionHeading>

Beyond the code, you’ll find me writing and curating ideas, spending quiet time in nature, or reading a good book. I also enjoy watching anime and films, gaming with friends, and exploring the arts. These pursuits help nurture my curiosity, spark my creativity, and maintain a healthy work-life balance.
