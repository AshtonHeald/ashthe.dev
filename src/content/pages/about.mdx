# About

---

I'm a frontend developer with a passion for creating thoughtful digital experiences. Currently, I work at Design Co where I lead the development of our design system, serving over 50 products and helping teams build consistent, accessible interfaces.

My approach to development is rooted in simplicity and intentionality. I believe the best interfaces are often the ones you don't noticeâ€”they just work. This philosophy extends to my code as well, where I strive for clarity and maintainability over cleverness.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy writing about web development, contributing to open source projects, and exploring new technologies. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of design and development, and how we can create better tools for building the web.

I live in San Francisco with my partner and our cat. Outside of work, you'll find me reading, hiking, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.
